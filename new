Napoli, Valeria
8/14 12:17 AM


I talked with Magued I had to do some changes. I implemented the changes in SC_LOG.INT_WMS.V_TD_GBL_SC_WMS_WAREHOUSE_TASK_IN_SEC . 

Changes are: 

I renamed the column views to  TIME_TAKEN_IN_SEC , TIME_TAKEN_WH_TASK_IN_SEC.
I renamed INDIRECT_TIME to WAITING_MOVING_TIME_IN_SEC 
I adjusted the formula for INDIRECT_TIME_IN_SEC  to  IFF(TIME_TAKEN_IN_SEC <= COALESCE(MAX_TASK_DURATION*60, 0), 0 ,TIME_TAKEN_IN_SEC - COALESCE(MAX_TASK_DURATION*60, 0) )AS INDIRECT_TIME_IN_SEC after talk with Magued.

As a summary  we can use view V_TD_GBL_SC_WMS_WAREHOUSE_TASK_IN_SEC  to fill the target table. 

We have to add the changes in the column name in the target table. 

 

Can we create the summary view (V_TD_GBL_SC_WMS_OPERATOR_PERFORMANCE) on top of table T_TD_GBL_SC_WMS_WAREHOUSE_TASK ?

Magued told me that have the aggregation version will help him with the validation
