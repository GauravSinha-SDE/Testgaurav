Parameter unit ambiguity: PA_TO for PROCESS='WMS' AND CATE='IND_TIME' confirmed as minutes; discussion to convert to seconds in the view/table led to inconsistency risk.
Negative times verification: Initial OG09/F61319 test showed no negatives, then was corrected—indicating test query/config confusion.
Naming/schema churn begins: Early use of V_TD_GBL_SC_WMS_WAREHOUSE_TASK_IN_SEC vs later canonical view/table caused drift.
2025-08-14

Spec/view drift: Renamed columns (TIME_TAKEN_IN_SEC, TIME_TAKEN_WH_TASK_IN_SEC), renamed INDIRECT_TIME to WAITING_MOVING_TIME_IN_SEC, and adjusted INDIRECT_TIME_IN_SEC formula; DIRECTION logic updated. Table not yet aligned.
Objects created with spec mismatch: V_TD_GBL_SC_WMS_WAREHOUSE_TASK, T_TD_GBL_SC_WMS_WAREHOUSE_TASK, V_TD_GBL_SC_WMS_OPERATOR_PERFORMANCE created; BRD vs implementation column names misaligned.
Loading approach: Table loaded via CTAS from view; process clarity needed for refresh cadence.
New requirement for HU metric: Need per-task HU indicator with 1 per distinct source HU and 0.5 for repeats.
2025-08-15

Formula churn: WAITING_MOVING_TIME_IN_SEC changed again in the view; downstream SQL needed updates.
Record count discrepancy: BE09/U16074 2025‑08‑01 returned 15 rows vs expected 419; suspected shift logic but root cause unclear.
2025-08-18

Stakeholder deadline pressure: Urgent validation required before holidays; status uncertainty on open issues.
2025-08-20

Missing field in table: CONFIRMED_AT_WH requested and added to table after the fact.
Stale table vs fresh view: Stakeholder using view-on-table saw outdated results; table refresh needed to reflect latest view logic.
HU totals validation: DISTINCT SOURCE_HU totals matched Excel, but expectation alignment still unclear.
Operational cadence: Asked to schedule table refresh; concern about resource usage—no automated refresh defined.
Early-shift test setup: Requested concrete filters to reproduce early-arrival issues.
2025-08-22

Idle/non-operational windows: 03:30–05:30 gaps affecting shift mapping.
Shift hours must be parameterized: 12-hour static assumption not viable across sites.
ROW_NUMBER partitioning bug: PARTITION BY ... , CONFIRMED_DATE reset RN daily; removing date fixed first-task identification in tests.
2025-08-26–27

Limited testing of new objects: New view/table noted as not extensively tested.
HU_COUNT gap closed: HU_COUNT added to view/table after request.
Data recency confusion: Some reviewers not seeing latest outputs.
Month filter ordering issue: LIKE '2025-08%' produced out-of-order rows (Aug 10 before Aug 06), skewing durations.
2025-08-28–29

Early arrival handling flaw: First row anchored to shift start produced negative times (e.g., −5987 on 2025‑08‑10).
Multiple “first tasks”: RN logic marked two first tasks in a day (BE09/F33314, 2025‑08‑11..13).
24-hour sessions inferred: Cross-day stitching/tz confusion made operators appear to work 24 hours (BI09); close-shift 2025‑08‑02 10:05:33 should map to 2025‑08‑03 shift but didn’t; errors propagated to subsequent shifts.
Recommendation: Base on WH timezone and CONFIRMED_AT_WH to improve accuracy.
2025-09-01–02

Timezone conversion/source field errors: Used CC_TIMEZONE instead of ZCOMMENT; inserted TZs like “CST - America/Chicago” or “UTC‑7” (non‑IANA); corrected to use proper IANA zones.
Final shift start misassignment:
BE09/C20976: 2025‑08‑07 06:19 arrival (early for 07:00) mapped to prior evening 2025‑08‑06 19:00.
PA09/U31163: final shift start still incorrect across cases.
Root cause area: “One shift per operator” selection causing wrong FINAL_SHIFT_SESSION_ID.

2025-08-22

Idle/non-operational windows: 03:30–05:30 noted impacting shift mapping (00:45).
Shift hours must be parameterized: 12-hour static assumption rejected (00:48).
ROW_NUMBER partitioning bug: PARTITION BY ... , CONFIRMED_DATE caused daily RN resets; proposed removing date (00:51–00:55). Fix tested by removing date; worked for 1–2 operators (01:50–02:13).
2025-08-26

New objects created but lightly tested: V_TD_GBL_SC_WMS_WAREHOUSE_TASK_FINAL and T_TD_GBL_SC_WMS_WAREHOUSE_TASK_FINAL (22:14–22:15).
2025-08-27

HU_COUNT missing then added: requested (22:09); formula confirmed (22:13); added to view/table (22:19).
Data recency confusion: stakeholders possibly not seeing latest outputs (22:39–22:42).
Month filter ordering issue: Using LIKE '2025-08%' for F51839 yielded out-of-order records (Aug 10 before Aug 06), skewing time deltas (23:37).
2025-08-28

Early arrival handling flaw → negative times: For F51839 on 2025-08-10, first task at 13:50:13 vs shift 03:30/15:30; waiting/moving time −5987 because first-row logic anchored to shift start even when arriving early (00:12–00:18).
Two “first tasks” on same day: RN/first-task logic misflagging; BE09/F33314 over 2025-08-11..13 (00:53–01:36).
2025-08-29

24-hour sessions inferred (stitching across days/TZ): Aggregate showed 24h for BI09 operators (01:10–01:39).
Timezone mismatch in parameters: Business provided shift table in local time; BI09 is EST, but UTC assumptions applied; recommended adjusting parameter table (02:01).
Shift boundary misassignment persists: Example where close shift 2025-08-02 10:05:33 should map to 2025-08-03 11:30 (local), but treated as same shift; error propagates to next shifts (02:10–02:20).
Another WH shows same pattern: Additional operator example exhibiting stitching (02:36).
Recommendation: Use WH timezone-based shifts and CONFIRMED_AT_WH for calculations (18:49).
2025-09-01

Timezone conversion/source field errors: Used CC_TIMEZONE instead of ZCOMMENT; inserted TZs like “CST - America/Chicago” and “UTC-7” (ambiguous); fix acknowledged (20:53–21:32; corrected later).
Dynamic timezone worksheet shared: For Snowflake conversion references (21:04–21:08, 21:37).
WH timezone mapping provided: E.g., JK09/MA09/PA09… America/Chicago; BI09/FA09/BE09… America/New_York; NS09 listed as UTC-7 (needs IANA) (21:17–21:18).
Parameter inserts executed: Mixed formats; later recognized formatting issue (21:32).
2025-09-02

Final shift start misassignment (morning mapped to prior evening):
BE09/C20976: Confirmed at 2025-08-07 06:19 (early for 07:00 shift), but FINAL_SHIFT_START_TS = 2025-08-06 19:00 (01:41–01:43).
PA09/U31163: “Final shift start still incorrect” (00:38).
Root cause direction: “One shift per operator” selection logic implicated; needs rework (17:25). Impact: wrong FINAL_SHIFT_SESSION_ID (20:17).
Source TZ fix applied: Switched to ZCOMMENT (00:18–00:24).
